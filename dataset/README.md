## Recording Tips
- Make sure your WAV files are mono, 22050Hz, 16-bit (You can check with: ```ffmpeg -i 0001.wav```)
- Record in a quiet room with minimal echo and noise.

- Speak naturally but clearly — don’t rush.
- Keep each sentence in a separate file if possible (makes training easier).
- Try a few takes with different tones or speeds if you want your model to handle more variation.
